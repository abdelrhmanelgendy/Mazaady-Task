*  Domain layer contains mainly project Business rules, and consist of Domain Named Objects, Repositories, Mappers, and application use cases 
*  Presentation layer contains UI related and dependent Apis, it contains The, Components, Navigation, ViewModels, UI State, UI Intent, and framework Apis-Activities..etc
*  buildSrc + Kotlin DSLDependency management for better usability and easy maintenance

* Retrofit : type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services
* coroutines : a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* Dagger Hilt : a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection
* MVVM :using a Jetpack libraries view model and live data  

# What Test cases coverage ? 
* Use cases test: create a test for every use case i depend on at the project,create a test for the important logic parts
* Repository tests.
* Use cases test.
* Adapters Diff Utils.
